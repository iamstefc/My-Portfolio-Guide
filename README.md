# Author's Note

Hi! Welcome to a version of my portfolio! I'm currently in the mist of preparing a blog site which will include an organized list of concepts and tools I used during my data career, as well as projects which I have contributed while at startups. I will dive into greater detail when the blog rolls out, but its going to be made for the purpose of tracking the growth of my career and hopefully it'll help aspiring data enthusiasts like myself to pursue a career in data, whether it be BI Analyst, Data Analyst, Analytics Engineering, or Analytics Manager. More to come in the near future!

Finally, you may have noticed a gap in activity inside my personal GitHub profile. For my previous job, I put more effort in projects housed in GitHub and continued support of team efforts and explorations using those accounts. Other previous position also protected their data assets so I'm unable to showcase those projects.

For now, I list out all the concepts, topics, and projects I contributed or explored:

Data modeling 
Data cataloging
Metadata
Strategize data migration and infrastructure transition
Moving away from ETL to ELT
Getting stakeholder buy-in for adopting data cataloging tools
Organizing dbt Project: Where we failed and how we succeeded
Combining Inmon with Kimball in dbt
Data warehouse
dbt exploring SCD Type 2 manual implementation vs snapshots
dbt - models, macros (JINJA), snapshots
dbt Cloud vs dbt Core: Which should your team use for onboarding
Data visualization tools
Exploring the data maturity ladder
My take on Power BI vs Mode



All tools I have used in my career, I have listed them on the main page of my github
